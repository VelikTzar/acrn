Welcome back! You cannot believe it! You have in fact remained committed to something! Shocking, you know! The Reader should hold their breath, you could still give up at any second.\
You told a friend of yours recently that the only thing worse than your prose is your poetry (and the Reader should trust you, your prose is quite bad). Didn't stop you from subjecting her to the 
unsually cruel punishment of having to read it. In any case, go wild, dear Reader. Go ahead.But they shouldn't blame you for not warning them it'd be subpar. 


***\
A man on the moon! \\
What a guy! \\
Sent so soon! \\
A better man we could not find! \\
What a star! \\
A victory for all mankind! 

Boom! And out comes a great cry! \
The shuttle’s blown! The horror! The humanity! \
Not to worry, we will save him \
We’re assembling help with alacrity!

*

I am on the moon
 
The shuttle’s blown \
I hear the voice in my ear \
“We’ll come, never fear” 

Pointless platitudes! What fools! \
I’ve done the math long ago\
My oxygen will run out long before \
They send more unfortunate souls

Stop! Would you stop!\
I care not for your lies\
The only question is \
How soon my death lies 

I turn off the useless sound \
I look upon the endless gray \
I’ll die on this nameless mound\
I’ll die, so far away 

A circle of blue and white in the black sky \
How could I have known it’d go so awry \
Oh Earth, you’re so far away\
Oh Earth, I reach out to you \
Oh Earth, why didn’t I stay\
Oh Earth, tell me what to do 

No, no, I will not die \
On this barren rock\
No, no, hear my cry 

My oxygen is running out\
It’ll not last long enough for them to come \
Why am I screaming so loud \
It matters not either way, facts cannot be overcome 

No matter how powerful my spirit is \
I’ll die \
on this barren rock 




I look upon the gray sands \
I look upon a cloudless sky \
I look upon the one spot of color, \
I look upon Mother Earth

I reach my hand out to you\
Almost there, almost within reach\
But I know you are impossibly far\
No matter how much I beseech 

I look upon the gray sands\
Could you ever have been, \
oh Earth\
With so many colorful lands \
With so many things unseen 

No, no the gray sands are all that must have been\
They flash before me, covering every memory \
They’re coming, soon they’ll cover me \
I can’t remember any of the things I’ve seen



Was it ever real?\
The color of the morning sky\
Was it ever real?\
The color of my first love’s eyes \
Was it ever real?\
All the meals full of spice \
Was it ever real? \
All the days I told these little lies 

It couldn’t have been, it was always gray and black\
Why am I hurting for what never was\
It couldn’t have been, it was always silent \
Why am I hurting, for what was always just a dream

This is all. You’re a nothing, always been but a dream  \
and my life nothing, but this moment \
All I see is gray and black, with no one to hear me scream \
and my life just this moment, unseen 

Oh Earth\
Impossibly far, yet within my grasp  \
Oh Earth\
You never were, how could you have ever been \
Oh Earth,\
I don’t even know what I want you to be \
Oh Earth,\
Why are you there, reminding me of all you could be \
Oh Earth,\
Leave me, please leave me.

He died. What a great sorrow for mankind.

This is one way to preserve a creation forever \* (not really, you believe technology to be very fragile but that is by the by, more on that another time)\
Many years ago, you had written a poem for a friend of yours, for her birthday. It was only on that piece of paper. And it is lost forever, for you haven't talked in the many years since. 
What a wacky occurence! Many Such Cases!
You were so sad back then, though how distant it all seems to you now. You often wonder what she has become. In your mind she is still as she was. \
People have lives outside of your conception of them in your mind - preposterous!\
You will say this. You were young then. Or you could have been. You could have lived - and what would have become of you now? \
Someone far better, someone still young, someone still alive. \
See, this is the kind of nonsense they signed up for - writing a journal just for yourself is boring, there needs to be the thrill of baring you soul. But you cannot afford to lose your friends by blabbering this nonsense every time you meet. \
No, you need *them*, the dear Reader, to gaze into your shallow depths.\
You know them not, and you never will, and that's perfect.

An update on the website itself - now there is somewhat tolerable formatting when reading on mobile. It is still hardly responsive, God help you if you do not have the exact same dimensions as my phone or laptop. No, I didn't use bootstrap, it's been almost 3 years since I last did, and I have completely forgotten everything. You can't make me. @media is what a true lion needs. (I am an Aries.)

I have a thing today. A very important thing, that I mentioned in the **[Welcome](https://acrn.co.uk/welcome/2025/01/11/welcome.html)** (it is all connected!) post that I ignored to work on this Nonsense(*But I can't help myself*). My colleagues seem to like my work, let's hope the hostiles (panel of strangers) do as well. My pride can't handle the fall. Stay tuned for updates! (<3)
I'll be back in a couple days with a longer (and less painful but more boring, depending on your personal perversions, of course) post. The Antipodes Await. Hopefully. Who knows, I could make something shorter if something new were to pique my interest. Godspeed! (I ate your drywall).
