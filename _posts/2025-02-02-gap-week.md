What did you expect? Geniunely. I'll admit, I tried my best. I *wanted* to have the Trouble in Thebes post ready by now. Alas, I was bedridden for most of the week, my strength brought down by terrible illness. Thus, Thebes will wait, just one more week. I do have a vaguely informative thing I'm working on, that'll hopefully be out within a couple of days, in addition to the already promised post. Overpromise and underdeliver!

But you aren't a stranger to procrastination. Despite that, you can feel the guilt in your heart. So much that could have been, huh. \
I'll see you soon, dear Reader.
