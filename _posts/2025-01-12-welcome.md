Welcome to ACRN! What can you expect? A weekly (hopefully) post, by yours truly, VelikTzar, BSc. I am unfortunately not particularly good at anything, but am bad to mediocre at many things, so who knows what you can expect? From musings on many a topic when slightly inebriated to sharing anything I might be working on. In fact, you could say the existence of this website is a showcase of something I've worked on (and gives you an indication on the quality).\
Considering I'll be treating this as a monologue with myself, I'll be shocked you, dear reader, are one day more than a figment of my imagination. May merit sacrificing a goat. 
_MORE WILL BE REVEALED IN DUE TIME_\
This thing is hosted on GitHub pages, and it took me far too many hours to be able to set it up, but if the *WIP*s everywhere aren't any indication, I'm stil wasting my limited life on working on the formatting. Rest assured, I'll return next week with an actual post. 
Godspeed! I may or may not be in your walls next time we meet!


I must mention the person who pushed me to make this (and not work on an actually important project with an impeding deadline just so he can feel more accountable working on his own blog), Commodore Bob Johnson.
